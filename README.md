# airbnb-price-pred


The project predicts the prices of Airbnb listings in New York with the open dataset provided by the company. 

The focus of this project is not so much on achieving a higher $R^2$ through feature engineering but rather through attempting and tuning a variety of models, including an innovative cluster-wise decision trees algorithm that I coded from scratch.

Since this is a regression problem, the evaluation metric is $R^2$.
